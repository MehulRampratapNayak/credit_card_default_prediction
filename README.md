# **üí≥Credit Card Default Prediction**

In this project i have created a  web app with predictive model for credit card default Prediction. Which is will help banks and loan lenders to predict whether customers will default 
the credit card payment or not, so the bank or respective departments can take 
necessary action, based on the model's predictions. The UI is made to be user-friendly 
so that the user will not need much knowledge of any tools but will just need the 
information for results

implemented to perform above mention use case. ln this case, we have to enter the 
last six months bill amounts , paid amounts, payment status, credit limit, personal 
details. Based on the above details model predicts we whether customers will default the credit card payment or not
